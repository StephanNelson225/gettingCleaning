The Ultra has the same features as the original FitBit, with one major addition: an altimeter. With the altimeter, Ultra knows how much elevation you lose or gain throughout a day. That's valuable information because inclines are hard work. For example, if you climb the stairs in an 80-story building, you'll burn morecalories than if you'd gone the same distance on a flat sidewalk outside

The linchpin of FitBit is its three-dimensional accelerometer system. In plain language, that just means it tracks motion, as well as the intensity of that motion.

With a lot of trial-and-error, FitBit has learned how to track and convert your energy expenditures (tracked by the accelerometer) into information about the number of calories you burn. Likewise, the company's testers have developed algorithms that work well for tracking the steps you take and how far you've moved.

The BodyMedia Fit is an armband equipped with four types of sensors that supposedly capture around 5,000 data points every minute. In addition to a motion sensor, it logs temperature, galvanic skin response and heat flux, which relates to the amount of heat that's dissipating from your body. Together, these sensors may provide a clearer picture of your overall activity and health.

with accelerometers, gyroscopes and other motion sensors, 

6 and 9-axis MotionTrackingâ„¢ solutions have the ability to accurately identify and characterize a broad range of fitness activities allowing for very accurate calculations of, for example, calorie burn rate over time.
