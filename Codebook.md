The tidy dataset ( tidyactivitymonitor.txt) submitted for this  project has the dimension of 10,088 rows by four variable columns.  This tidy data is in the long format with the first column being that variable name the second column the subject number, the third column is the activity name and the fourth column is the mean of the variable measures for the given subject and activity.  This calculated values is named  "averagemeasurebysubjectsactivity".

The means represent values for 66 variables, for each of 30 subjects and 6 activity types.  The variables and their descriptions follow:

**Construction of Variable Names**
The names of the variables are cleaned versions of the variable names provided derived from the names provided in the features.txt file. Generally, the original names followed this example format:

 tBodyAcc-mean()-X 
 t=domain name time or frequency

 Body=signal type "body" or "gravity," as separated via filtering of the signals

 Acc= measuring device "accelerometer" or "gyroscope"

 mean()-X= statistic "mean" or "standard deviation" and axis in xyz space.

This format had several problems that needed to be addressed from the standpoint of tidy names.  First, the symbols "()" and "-" can be misinterpreted by R and needed to be removed.  Second, there is a mix of small and large cap letters which complicated key strokes.  I chose the following format for variable names:

"t.body.acc.mean.x"

My standard is to separate the major features with ".", maintain lowercase letters, and keep short identifier segments.  My point of view is that I am creating these names for researchers who are relatively familiar with this dataset and I want to them to not need a lot of keystrokes but provide a good visual distinction between variables so that they can identify the variable at a glance. I used the longer names for "gravity" and "magnitude" which were less common among the variables.  Note: there seemed to be a few typos "bodybody" that I changed to "body".  My style follows the most common naming convention and allows for understandable but compact names. see http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-2/RJournal_2012-2_Baaaath.pdf.  The conventions that seemed to be endorsed in the forums created very clumsy names that did not fit with exploratory graphics or tabular summaries.

The procedure for refining variable names used the gsub function sequenced in a way that would get my desired result.  

**Subjects**

There are 30 unique subjects (identified by the numbers 1-30) represented in this dataset.  The subjects were designated either "test" or "training".  This distinction is important for the statistical analysis and refinement of the data estimates but is not important for this assignment so no distinction is made. 

**Activity**

There are six activities that are represented by the data.  The activities are: Walking, Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying.  The main goal of activity monitoring is to correctly identify from the monitoring device measurements what the subject is doing and for how long.  

**Calculated value: averagemeasurebysubjectsactivity**

There is one mean for each of the 10,088 combinations of variable, subject and activity. Shown below are the mean values for t.body.acc.mean.x for subject "1" by activity.

This mean is a mean of all of the observations for that subject that as classified by activity. 

###**Raw Data**  ###

The raw data were provided in the inertial signals folder provide with the UCI HAR Dataset.  They include 9 very large files or reading from the accelerometer and gyroscope in the Samsung devices worn by the 30 subjects.  

The files represent body acceleration readings on the x, y and z vectors, body gyroscope readings on the x, y and Z vectors and total body acceleration readings on the x,y and Z vectors.  

These data were refined and modified to create the 561 variables in the test and training sets.

The 3-axial time domain signals from accelerometer and gyroscope were captured at a constant rate of
50 Hz. Then they were filtered to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another filter. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these time domain signals to obtain frequency
domain signals.


 **Working data**

These data were provided to students in The training data had a dimension of 561 columns representing the features and 7352 rows of observations. The test data had a dimension of 561 columns representing the features and 2941 rows of observations.

Students received the following files:

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training activity id code.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test activity id code.
'subject_test.txt':  Test subject id.
'subject_train.txt':  Training subject id.

In order to accomplish the project, the test and training sets were rbinded together and cbinded with the subject and activity.  The activity labels were linked to the activity codes to create a final master file of 68 columns and 10,299 rows. 

Finally the features.txt file was subsetted by to include only the columns with labels that included the terms "-mean() or -std()" which eliminated all but 66 of the 561 features.  The feature names had been cleaned as described above. 

These data were then "melted" in a long format resulting in an intermediate data frame of 679,734 X 4 and then "group_by" subject activity and mean  into a data frame of 11,880 by 4.  This is the tidy data set.
